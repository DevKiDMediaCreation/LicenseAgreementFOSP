## General license agreement
If you use a free or open source project, the rules of the license agreement apply. If your project has a license agreement that tells you that the rules of this protocol or license agreement do not apply, use of this project is not allowed.

Changing the license as a user is strictly forbidden. Only the creators are allowed to change the license contract or agreement as long as the project is still free and open source.

The creators are not allowed to change the license within the General part and the Intergral Commision of Tenten.  The users using the project must accept the license and enter the creator's name in the markdown text under the license version. Example: "###### From DevKiD [date] [time] [country]*[abbreviation] [region]*[abbreviation] [city]*[abbreviation]"

The user must markdown their name and ID below the creator's ID. "###### From [User] [date] [time] [country]* [abbreviation] [region]* [abbreviation] [city]* [abbreviation]"

The * means you can use the abbreviation or the full name.
